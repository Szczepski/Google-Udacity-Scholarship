			<p class="description">Their outline is characterised by a pronounced hump. The head hangs down, low to the ground; they look up only when alarmed. White rhinos have two horns on the end of their nose. The front horn is usually much larger than the inner horn. Rhinos are known for their distinct 'prehistoric', solid look; an appropriate labelling for one of the oldest land mammal species in the world.
